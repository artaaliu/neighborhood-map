** Neighborhood Map **
----
Here is my website which shows some beautiful places in Florida.
On the right side you have a map which tells where are those places that you can visit,
and on the left side are the name of the places.

###### you can see the name of places, *"name:"*,
###### you can see the address of places, *"address"*,
###### you can see the latitude of places, *'lat'*,
###### you can see the longitude of places, *'lng'*,
###### you can see the foursquare api of the places, *'fsID'*

## I did the page responsive ##
## it's made with bootstrap, so there are to colomos, the first one is col-md-4 and the second col-md-8##

On the left side you can see that I did a button for searching places.
You can write the name of the place on the box that you see empty, and then click the
button **"Search for it!"**. After you search the place that you decide to visit,
than you can see the marker on the map. After you write the name on the box for searching, you can see that
the other places that you have on the list under the box will be hidden, but when you 
refresh the page the list of the places with be there again. 
When you will move the mouse on the list you can see that they will underline and you can 
click on one of them and it will be opened on the same small box like it was showed like
you did when you type the name for searching.

## I did a second class with the name <div class="second-list">##

On the second list that you can see under the first one, is the text "Read more about those
places", and on that list you can read hat wikipedia tells about those amazing places.
You can click on the places and after you click it will shows the wikipedia page.
People can read more about those places and than dicide which one they want to visit.

## when you click on them you can see that there is a link which will open a page for more details,
<a href="#"></a>
